# Moodicial

A public website where everyone can post anything, anyone can be called as their want and no one can see who posted what; if it shouldn't be there, just report it!

## Features

Currently, Moodicial is in a really early alpha stage. Even though it isn't a complex software, it's a good idea to understand that it's not fully tested and bugs and huge security flaws are expected.

#### Working features

- Posting
- Reporting
- Nicknames
- Infinite scrolling
- Responsive design
- HTML parsing block (protects against user from running HTML code on their posts)
- Comments
- Installer
- Reduced code size and overall final HTML size
- Support for secure source code displaying of PHP files (complying with AGPL)

#### Upcoming features

- Corrected coding performance problems
