# Moodicial

A public website where everyone can post anything, anyone can be called as their want and no one can see who posted what; if it shouldn't be there, just report it!

## Features

Currently, Moodicial is in a really early alpha stage. Even though it isn't a complex software, it's a good idea to understand that it's not fully tested and bugs and huge security flaws are expected.

#### Working features

- Posting
- Reporting
- Nicknames
- Infinite scrolling (with status displaying)
- Responsive design
- HTML parsing block (protects against user from running HTML code on their posts)
- Comments
- Installer
- Reduced code size and overall final HTML size
- Support for secure source code displaying of PHP files (complying with AGPL)
- Full translation support, included languages are Spanish (Latin America) and English (United States), Portuguese (Brazil) and Bulgarian (Bulgaria)
- Automatic language detection
- Dynamic updates (new content)
- Detected language badge
- Offline mode (host yourself, in your own network)
- Rate limits (how much interactions can someone do in a user-defined timespan)
- Web API as a limited service with private key
- NoJS automatic detection and NoScript mode

#### Upcoming features

- Nothing to document yet.

## Known bugs

- No bugs found for now.

## System requirements

- **Any** web server supporting PHP 5.x or greater.
- **Any** kind of networking access (works on localhost and offline/LAN).
- **SSL** PHP module (even if you aren't gonna use it, third party files are downloaded from secure servers).
- At least **220 KB** of free storage (**172 KB** for the source code, **48 KB** for the database contents).

## Installation

Here comes the good part. For **download**, **configuration** and **installation**, please [take a look at the wiki](https://github.com/FacuM/moodicial/wiki).

## Wanna try it?

If you find any security flaw, report it! :wink:
